# Classification Models with Pyspark 

Applying a multi-class classifier to classify data into ten classes (categories): one normal and nine attacks (e.g., Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode and Worms). 

# About the data set 

The raw network packets of the UNSW-NB151 dataset was created by the IXIA PerfectStorm tool in the Cyber Range Lab of the Australian Centre for Cyber Security (ACCS) for generating a hybrid of real modern normal activities and synthetic contemporary attack behaviours. Tcpdump tool used to capture 100 GB of the raw traffic (e.g., Pcap files). This data set has nine types of attacks, namely, Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode and Worms. The Argus and Bro-IDS tools are used and twelve algorithms are developed to generate totally 49 features with the class label
